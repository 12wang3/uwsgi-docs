Installing uWSGI
================

Installing from a distribution package
--------------------------------------

.. seealso:: See the :doc:`Download` page for a list of known distributions shipping uWSGI.

Installing from source
----------------------

To build uWSGI you need python and a c compiler (gcc and clang are supported).

Based on the languages you want to support you will need their development headers.

On a Debian/Ubuntu system you can install them (and the rest of the infrastructure required to build software) with:

.. code-block:: sh

   apt-get install build-essential python

And if you want to build a binary with python/wsgi support

.. code-block:: sh

   apt-get install python-dev

If you have a variant of `make` available in your system you can simply run `make`.

If you do not have `make` (or want to have more control) simply run:

.. code-block:: sh

   python uwsgiconfig.py --build

You can also use pip to install uWSGI (it will build a binary with python support). 

.. code-block:: sh

   # Install the latest stable release:
   pip install uwsgi
   # ... or if you want to install the latest LTS (long term support) release,
   pip install http://projects.unbit.it/downloads/uwsgi-lts.tar.gz

Or you can use ruby gems

.. code-block:: sh

   # Install the latest stable release:
   gem install uwsgi

Alternative build profiles
--------------------------

For historical reasons when you run 'make', uWSGI is built with Python as the only supported language.

You can build customized uWSGI servers using build profiles, located in the `buildconf/` directory.

You can use a specific profile with 

.. code-block:: sh

   python uwsgiconfig --build <profile>

Or you can pass it via an environment variable:

.. code-block:: sh

   UWSGI_PROFILE=lua make
   # ... or even ...
   UWSGI_PROFILE=gevent pip install uwsgi
