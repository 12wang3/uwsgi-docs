SharedArea -- share memory pages between uWSGI components
=========================================================

.. warning::

  SharedArea is a very low-level mechanism.
  For an easier-to-use alternative, see the :doc:`Caching<Caching>` and :doc:`Queue<Queue>` frameworks.
  
.. warning::

  This page refers to "new generation" sharedarea introduced in uWSGI 1.9.21, the older API is no more supported.

The sharedarea subsystem allows you to share pages of memory between your uWSGI components (workers, spoolers, mules, etc.)
in a very fast (and safe) way.

Contrary to the higher-level :doc:`caching framework<Caching>`, sharedarea operations are way faster (a single copy instead of the double, as required by caching) and offers
various optimizations for specific needs.

Each sharedarea (yes, you can have multiple areas) has a size (generally specified in the number of pages), so if you need an 8 KiB shared area on a system with 4 KiB pages, you would use ``sharedarea=2``.

The sharedarea subsystem is fully thread-safe.

Simple option VS keyval
***********************

The sharedarea subsystem exposes (for now) a single option: ``--sharedarea``.

It takes two kinds of arguments: the number of pages (simple approach) or a keyval arg (for advanced tuning).

The following keyval keys are available:

* ``pages`` -- set the number of pages
* ``file`` -- create the sharedarea from a file that will be ``mmap``\ ed
* ``fd`` -- create the sharedarea from a file descriptor that will be ``mmap``\ ed
* ``size`` -- mainly useful with the ``fd`` and ``ptr`` keys to specify the size of the map (can be used as a shortcut to avoid calculation of the ``pages`` value too)
* ``ptr`` -- directly map the area to the specified memory pointer.
