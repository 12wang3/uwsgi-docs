Running Ruby/Rack webapps on Heroku with uWSGI
==============================================

Prerequisites: a Heroku account (on the ceddar platform), git (on the local system) and the heroku toolbelt (or the old/deprecated heroku gem)

Note: you need a uWSGI version >= 1.4.8 to correctly run ruby/rack apps. Older versions may work, but are not supported.

Preparing the environment (a Sinatra application)
*************************************************

On your local system prepare the structure for your sinatra application

.. code-block: sh

   mkdir uwsgi-heroku
   cd uwsgi-heroku
   git init .
   heroku create --stack cedar
   

the last command will create a new heroku application (you can check it on the web dashboard).

Next step is creating our Gemfile (this file containes the gem required by the application)

.. code-block:: rb

   source 'https://rubygems.org'

   gem "uwsgi"
   gem "sinatra"

we now need to run ``bundle install`` to create the Gemfile.lock file

let's track the two with git:

.. code-block:: sh

   git add Gemfile
   git add Gemfile.lock

Finally create a config.ru file containing the Sinatra sample app

.. code-block:: rb

   require 'sinatra'

   get '/hi' do
     return "ciao"
   end

   run Sinatra::Application

and track it

.. code-block:: sh

   git add config.ru

Creating the uWSGI config file
******************************

We are now ready to create the uWSGI configuration (we will use the .ini format in a file called uwsgi.ini).

The minimal setup for heroku is the following (check the comments in the file for an explanation)

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   ; bind to the heroku required port
   http-socket = :$(PORT)
   ; force the usage of the ruby/rack plugin for every request (7 is the official numbero for ruby/rack)
   http-socket-modifier1 = 7
   ; load the bundler subsystem
   rbrequire = bundler/setup
   ; load the application
   rack = config.ru
   ; when the app receives the TERM signal let's destroy it (instead of brutal reloading)
   die-on-term = true

but a better setup will be

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   ; bind to the heroku required port
   http-socket = :$(PORT)
   ; force the usage of the ruby/rack plugin for every request (7 is the official numbero for ruby/rack)
   http-socket-modifier1 = 7
   ; load the bundler subsystem
   rbrequire = bundler/setup
   ; load the application
   rack = config.ru
   ; when the app receives the TERM signal let's destroy it (instead of brutal reloading)
   die-on-term = true
   ; enable the master process
   master = true
   ; spawn 4 processes to increase concurrency
   processes = 4
   ; report memory usage after each request
   memory-report = true
   ; reload if the rss memory is higher than 100M
   reload-on-rss = 100

Let's track it

.. code-block:: sh

   git add uwsgi.ini

Deploying to heroku
*******************

We need to create the last file (required by Heroku). It is the Procfile, that instruct the Heroku system on which process to start for a web application.

We want to spawn uwsgi (installed as a gem via bundler) using the uwsgi.ini config file

.. code-block:: sh

   web: bundle exec uwsgi uwsgi.ini

track it

.. code-block:: sh

   git add Procfile

And let's commit all:

.. code-block:: sh

   git commit -a -m "first attempt"

And push to heroku:

.. code-block:: sh

   git push heroku master
