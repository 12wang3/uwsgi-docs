The XSLT plugin
===============

Since uWSGI 1.9.1 a new plugin named "xslt" is available, implementing xml transformation both as request handler and routing instruction.

To successfully apply a transformation you need a 'doc' (an xml document) and a stylesheet (the xslt file).

Additionally you can apply global params and set a specific content type (by default the generated output is set as text/html).

The request handler
*******************

The modifier1 23 has been assigned to the XSLT request handler.

The document path is created appending the PATH_INFO to the DOCUMENT_ROOT.

The stylesheet path is created following this steps:

- if a specific CGI var is set (via ``--xslt-var``) it will be used as the stylesheet path

- if a file named like the document plus a specific extension (by default .xsl and .xslt are searched) exists it will be used
as the stylesheet path

- finally a series of static xslt file (specified with ``--xslt-stylesheet``) is tried 

Examples:

.. code-block:: sh

   uwsgi --http-socket :9090 --http-socket-modifier1 23 --xslt-ext .bar

If /foo.xml is requested (and the file exists) DOCUMENT_ROOT+foo.xml.bar will be searched as the xslt file

.. code-block:: sh

   uwsgi --http-socket :9090 --http-socket-modifier1 23 --xslt-stylesheet /var/www/myfile1.xslt --xslt-stylesheet /var/www/myfile2.xslt

If /foo.xml is requested (and the file exists) /var/www/myfile1.xslt will be tried. If it does not exist, /var/www/myfile2.xslt will be tried instead

.. code-block:: sh

   uwsgi --http-socket :9090 --http-socket-modifier1 23 --xslt-var UWSGI_XSLT

If /foo.xml is requested (and the file exists), the content of the UWSGI_XSLT (you can set it from your webserver) is used as the stylesheet path.

If the QUERY_STRING is available, its item will be passed as global params.

As an example if you request /foo.xml?foo=bar&test=uwsgi

foo -> bar and test -> uwsgi will be passed as global vars:

.. code-block:: xml

   <xsl:value-of select="$foo"/>
   <xsl:value-of select="$test"/>

The routing instruction
***********************

The plugin register itself as internal routing instruction named "xslt". It is probably a lot more versatile then the request plugin.

Its syntax is pretty simple

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   plugin = xslt
   route = ^/foo xslt:doc=${DOCUMENT_ROOT}/${PATH_INFO}.xml,stylesheet=/var/www/myfunction.xslt,content_type=text/html,params=foo=bar&test=unbit


this will apply the /var/www/myfunction.xslt transformation to foo.xml and will return it as text/html

The only required parameters for the routing instruction are doc and stylesheet
