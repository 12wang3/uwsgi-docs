The gccgo plugin
================

uWSGI 1.9.20 officially substituted the old :doc:`Go` plugin with a new one based on gccgo.

The usage of gccgo allows more features and better integration with the uWSGI deployment styles.

A version of the gcc suite >= 4.8 is expected (and strongly suggested)

How it works
************

when the plugin is enabled a new go runtime is initialized after each fork()

if a main Go function is available in the process address space it will be executed in the Go runtime, otherwise to control
goes back to the uWSGI loop engine.
