This is a collection of the most "funny" uses of uWSGI features


X-Sendfile emulation
--------------------

Even if your frontend proxy/webserver does not support X-Sendfile (or cannot access your static resources) you can emulate
it using offloading (your process/thread will delegate the static file serving to offload threads

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   ...
   ; load router_static plugin (compiled in by default in monolithic profiles)
   plugins = router_static
   ; spawn 2 offload threads
   offload-threads = 2
   ; files under /private can be safely served
   static-safe = /private
   ; collect the X-Sendfile response header as X_SENDFILE var
   collect-header = X-Sendfile X_SENDFILE
   ; if X_SENDFILE is not empty, pass its value to the "static" routing action (it will automatically use offloading if available)
   response-route-if-not = empty:${X_SENDFILE} static:${X_SENDFILE}
   

Force HTTPS
-----------

this will force HTTPS for the whole site

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   ...
   ; load router_redirect plugin (compiled in by default in monolithic profiles)
   plugins = router_redirect
   route-if-not = equal:${HTTPS};on redirect-permanent:https://${HTTP_HOST}${REQUEST_URI}
   
and this for /admin

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   ...
   ; load router_redirect plugin (compiled in by default in monolithic profiles)
   plugins = router_redirect
   route = ^/admin goto:https
   ; stop the chain
   route-run = last:
   
   route-label = https
   route-if-not = equal:${HTTPS};on redirect-permanent:https://${HTTP_HOST}${REQUEST_URI}
