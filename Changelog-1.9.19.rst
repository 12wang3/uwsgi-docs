uWSGI 1.9.19
============

Changelog [work in progress]

This release starts the 'hardening' cycle for uWSGI 2.0 (scheduled for the end of december 2013).

The metrics subsystem was the last piece missing and this version (after 1 year of analysis) finally includes it.

During the following 2 months we will start deprecating features or plugins that got no-interest, are known to be broken or are simply superseed
by more modern/advanced ones.

Currently the following plugin and features are scheduled for removal:

- The Go plugin, superseeded by the gccgo one. (eventually the Go plugin will be brought back if something changes in the fork() support)
- Auto-snapshotting, was never documented, it has tons of corner case bugs and it is huber-complex. The features added by the :doc:`MasterFifo` allows for
better implementations of snapshotting.

Waiting for decision:

- the erlang plugin is extremely old, was badly engineered and should be completely rewritten. If you are a user of it, please contact the staff. Very probably we will not be able to maintain it without sponsorship.
- the matheval support could be removed soon (unless we find some specific use that could require it), substituted by some form of simple math directly implemented in the option parser
