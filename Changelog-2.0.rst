New features
************

--attach-daemon2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

this is a keyval based option for configuring external daemons.

Updated docs are: :doc:`ExternalDaemons`

Linux setns() support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



"private" hooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When uWSGI runs your hooks, it verbosely print the whole hook action line. This could be a security problem
in some scenario (for example when you run initial phases as root user but allows unprivileged access to logs).

Prefixing your action with a '!' will suppress full logging:

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   hook-asap = !exec:my_secret_command

Support for yajl library (JSON parser)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Perl spooler support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gateways can drop privileges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Subscriptions-governed SNI contexts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
