SSI (Server Side Includes) plugin
=================================

Server Side Includes are an "old-fashioned" way to write dynamic web pages.

It is generally recognized as a templating system instead of a full featured language.

The main purpose of the uWSGI SSI plugin is having a fast templating system that can use the uWSGI api.

Currently (March 2013) the plugin is in beta quality and implements less than 30% of the standard (the focus is in exposing uWSGI api as SSI commands)

Using it as a request handler
*****************************

The plugin has an official modifier, the 19:

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   plugin = ssi
   http = :9090
   http-modifier1 = 19
   http-var = DOCUMENT_ROOT=/var/www

The plugin build the filename as DOCUMENT_ROOT+PATH_INFO, the file is then parsed as a server side include.

Both DOCUMENT_ROOT and PATH_INFO are required, otherwise a 500 error will be returned.

An example config for nginx will be:

.. code-block:: c

   location ~ \.shtml$ {
       root /var/www;
       include uwsgi_params;
       uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:3031;
       uwsgi_modifier1 19;
   }

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   plugin = ssi
   socket = 127.0.0.1:3031

Using it as a routing action
****************************

A more versatile approach is using the ssi parser as a routing action:

.. code-block:: ini

   [uwsgi]
   plugin = ssi
   http-socket = :9090
   route = ^/(.*) ssi:/var/www/$1.shtml

the routign action does not need DOCUMENT_ROOT or PATH_INFO

Supported SSI commands
**********************

This is the list of supported commands (and their args). If a command is not part of the standard (read: uWSGI specific) it will be reported

echo
^^^^

args = ``var``

print the content of the specified request variable

printenv
^^^^^^^^

print the list of all of the request variables

include
^^^^^^^

args = ``file``

include the specified file (relative to the current directory)

cache
^^^^^

uWSGI specific/non standard

args = ``key`` ``name``

print the value of the specified cache key in the specified cache name

Status
******

The plugin is fully thread safe and very fast.

Very few commands are available, more will be added soon.
