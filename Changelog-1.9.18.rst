New Features

Use of the CPython buffer protocol for WSGI responses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Authors: yihuang with help of INADA Naoki (methane)

The WSGI (PEP333/3333) is pretty clear about the type of valid objects for responses: str for python2, bytes for python3

uWSGI (heavily using mod_wsgi as a reference) always enforced such behaviour, so "exotic" patterns like returning bytearray
where not supported. Such uses are somewhat involuntary supported on pure-python application servers, just because they simply call write() over them or because they cast them to string
before returning (very inefficient)

The patch proposed by yihuang suggests the use of the low-level buffer protocol exposed by the CPython C api. Strings (in python2) and bytes (in python3) support the buffer protocol, so its use is transparent
and backward compatibility is granted too. (for the CPython C api experts: yes we support both old and new protocol)

The result is that now you can return every object supporting the buffer protocol (like bytearray, array.array...) without making any conversion.

This is a violation of PEP, so if you feel a sinner (or want all of the sinners to be punished) just add the new option --wsgi-strict that will force the old mod_wsgi like behaviour.

The "raw" mode (preview technology, only for CPython)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While working on a new server-side project in Unbit we had the need to expose our web application using a very specific protocol (none of the ones supported by uWSGI).

Our first way was adding the new protocol as a plugin, but soon we realize that is was too-specific. So we decided to introduce the RAW mode.

Raw mode allows you to directly parse the request in your application callable. Instead of getting a list of CGI vars/headers in your callable
you only get the file descriptor soon after accept().

You can then read()/write() to that file descriptor in full freedom.

.. code-block:: python

   import os
   def application(fd):
      os.write(fd, "Hello World")
      
.. code-block:: sh

   uwsgi --raw-socket :7070 --python-raw yourapp.py

Raw mode disables request logging. We currently support it only for CPython, if we get reports (or interest) about it for the other languages we will add
support for sure.
